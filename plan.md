# Creatorverse Plan

## Informal stage

need to be able to add creators
and delete
and view
and edit
CRUD

basic flow

overall theme
- cool galaxy background, very lightly animated??
- nebula (space rainbows)
- fun vibe, weird little planets
- each creator represented as a fkn planet? in an orbiting universe?? 
- stars with size or heat based on popularity?
- use api of each's biggest platform to alter the planets
- do a clustering of their relationships to eachother, viewer demographic
- imagine how the universe might reorganize itself if suddenly one star was gone
- what is the v0 of this? I think it's a static star or planet display
- with face on hover
- some relative spacing with each other, where it rearranges if one is deleted
- if they were a celestial object what would they be? 
- is mrbeast the sun?? maybe the top genre person is the sun and all the people who comment on them are moons or planets, the people who feature with them are stars in a constellation?
- maybe v0 is a constellation in the shape of... user can drag them? drag to rearrange
- v0 is just straight up a non interactive list




home, includes display of creators, maybe a sort by alpha, sort by last updated?
- be able to drag and reorder the creators?
- big banner
- click on each creator
- add creator button
- nuclear button wipe all


each creator
- picture/thumbnail
- link
- delete button
- edit button

pages needed
- home
- view indiv creator
- create a card
- update could just be the create with fields populated 
- and save changes instead of create?

- home
- view
- create/edit


home, indiv creator view
